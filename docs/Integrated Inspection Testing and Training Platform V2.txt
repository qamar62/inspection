Workflow: Service Master Registry (Unified, Quality -
Controlled)  
Purpose  
Create a single Quality -owned master registry  of all services the organization performs 
(Inspection, Testing, Training, Operator Certification, Calibration).  
This registry is the single source of truth  that drives:  
 quotation service selection (dropdown)  
 job order scope and preloaded execution items  
 field execution forms (checklists / proformas / assessments)  
 certificate/report/card formats  
 approval routing  
 validity enforcement  
 audit traceability & versioning  
1. Ownership & Access Control  
Owner  
Quality Department  
 Quality Manager  
 Quality Executive  
 Management Representative (MR)  
Allowed Actions (Quality roles only)  
 Create / edit service definitions  
 Link standards /  procedures / templates  
 Define checklists / assessment templates  
 Define outputs (certificates, reports, wallet cards)  
 Define approval rules and validity rules  
 Publish new versions  
Read -only Users  
 Coordinators, Inspectors, Trainers, Finance (view only)  
 They  cannot change service definitions  

=== Page 14 ===

2. Service Catalog Structure (Unified)  
Each service has:  
2.1 Service Identity  
 Service Code  (unique, system -generated or governed format)  
 Service Name  (English + Arabic optional)  
o e.g., “Inspection – Mobile Crane”  
 Service Category  (one of):  
o Inspection  
o Testing  
o Training  
o Operator Certification  
o Calibration  
 Discipline  (optional refinement):  
o Lifting / HSE / NDT / Pressure / Electrical / etc.  
 Status: Active / Inactive  
 Effective Date (for versioning)  
Rule: Only Active  services appear in Quotation dropdowns.  
3. Execution Model (What the Field Needs)  
Quality sets “execution dependencies” per service:  
3.1 Requires Equipment?  
 Mandatory / Optional / Not Required  
3.2 Requires Person?  
 Mandatory / Optional / Not Required  
Examp les: 
 Inspection – Forklift → Equipment Mandatory  
 NDT – MPT → Equipment Optional (or Mandatory if you choose)  
 Training – Work at Height → Person Mandatory  
 Operator Certification – Mobile Crane → Person Mandatory  
 Calibration – Load Cell → Equipment Mandatory  
These flags drive:  

=== Page 15 ===

 what coordinator must preload in JO  
 what inspector/trainer must capture in field  
 what UI components appear  
4. Templates & Forms Linked to the Service  
4.1 For Inspection/Testing Services  
 Checklist Template (Critical master)  
 Default check list level shown in field:  
o Simplified / Expanded / Critical  
 Minimum enforced level:  
o Simplified / Expanded / Critical  
 “All OK” bulk -fill allowed? Yes/No  
 Evidence policy:  
o Photos required? Yes/No  
o Documents required? Yes/No (optional rule)  
Record Rule: Regardl ess of UI level used, the stored audit record is 
always “Critical” . 
4.2 For Training / Operator Certification Services  
 Proforma Template (identity + history)  
 Assessment Template (questions)  
 Pass/Fail criteria (score %, required sections)  
 Practical assessment required? Yes/No (flag)  
5. Standards & Procedures (Controlled References)  
Quality links controlled references to the service:  
 Standard(s) (e.g., ISO/EN/ASME/regulation)  
 Work Instruction / Procedure (WI)  
 Additional reference docs (optional)  
These  references automatically appear in:  
 execution forms (header)  
 reports/certificates  
 audit exports  
 

=== Page 16 ===

Inspectors/Trainers cannot change them.  
6. Output Definition (What Documents Are Produced)  
For each service, Quality defines the output package:  
6.1 Output Ty pes 
Any combination of:  
 Inspection Certificate  
 Test Report  
 Training Certificate (A4)  
 Wallet Card  
 Other controlled document (optional future)  
6.2 Output Templates  
 Template(s) per output type (versioned)  
 Letterhead category:  
o Inspection/Test Letterhead  
o Training Letterhead  
 Background handling:  
o Draft print copy (no background)  
o Final archival copy (with background + paper/card number)  
This links directly to your letterhead/card stock control module.  
7. Validity Rules (Service -Level Governance)  
Quality defin es: 
 Max validity (e.g., 6 months / 12 months) OR “Not Applicable”  
 Allowed preset options shown to inspector (e.g., 1/3/6/12/custom)  
 Exception behavior:  
o If inspector selects > max → route to approval  
8. Approval Routing (Service -Level Governance)  
Quality de fines:  
 Approval required? Yes/No  
 Approver role(s):  

=== Page 17 ===

o Technical Manager / NDT Manager / Sr Engineer / Team Lead  
 Multi -approver behavior (if enabled):  
o “Any one can approve” (parallel) OR “Must all approve” (rare)  
This is inherited automatically by:  
 certificates/reports generated from the service  
9. Commercial Control (Quotation Integration)  
To support quotation creation cleanly:  
 Each service has a “Quotation Display Name”  
 Optional internal service grouping for dropdown UX:  
o Lifting Inspection  
o NDT  
o HSE Training  
o Operator Certification  
o Calibration  
Prices do not live in the Service Registry  (pricing stays in quotation/client agreements).  
10. Versioning & Change Control (Mandatory)  
Any change to:  
 checklist  
 standards/procedure links  
 output templates  
 validity/ approval rules  
 assessment/proforma  
…creates a new service version . 
Rules:  
 Old versions are retained  
 Past Job Orders reference the service version active at the time  
 No deletions; only deactivation + versioning  
 Change requires:  
o change reason  
o approved -by (Quality Manager/MR)  

=== Page 18 ===

11. Operational Effects (What This Enables)  
Once this registry exists:  
 Coordinators build quotations using service dropdown  
 Job Orders inherit services, generating preloaded execution slots  
 Inspectors/Trainers see correct forms, rules,  outputs automatically  
 Certificates/reports/cards follow consistent lifecycle and controls  
 Finance receives clean, service -based executed quantities  
Key Principles (Non -Negotiable)  
 No Service in Registry → cannot be quoted → cannot be executed  
 Services define governance; execution cannot override governance  
 Equipment/person are execution parameters , not registry roots  
 One unified catalog prevents duplicates and “free text” chaos  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

=== Page 19 ===

Workflow: Quotation Module (Coordinator)  
Goal  
Coordinator creates  a formal quotation (with pricing + VAT + selected T&Cs) that later becomes 
the only allowed source for creating a Job Order.  
Inspectors never see pricing.  
1) Create Quotation (Entry Rules)  
Rule:  A Job Order can only be created from an Approved/Accepted Quotation . 
Quotation statuses  
 Draft  
 Sent  
 Accepted (client confirmation / PO / verbal)  
2) Quotation Header (Client + Project)  
Step 2A — Select Client  
 Search/select existing client  
 If new: create minimal client (name, VAT no if applicable, address, contact)  
Step 2B — Select Project/Site  
 Select existing project/site under client OR create new  
 Project fields: name, address, site contact(s)  
Step 2C — Quotation metadatary  
 Quote date (today by default and changable)  
 Validity period (e.g., 7/14/30 days — configurable default 30 days)  
 Reference number (auto -generated: e.g., QT -TUVINSP -####)  
 Currency (default SAR ) 
3) Service Selection + Pricing (Line Items)  
Coordinator builds the quote using your Services Catalog . 

=== Page 20 ===

 
Step 3A — Add Line Items  
Each line item inc ludes:  
 Service item (from Service Master Registry – published services)  
e.g., “Inspection – Mobile Crane”, “Inspection – Forklift”, “Operator Certification – 
Motor Grader”  
o System must show only services that are:  
 Active , and  
 Published  (Quality -approved), and  
 Effective (based on version effective dates)  
o Quotation must store service reference as:  
 service_id (stable service identity)  
 service_version_id (the published version used at quote time)  
 Service name snapshot (for PDF/history safet y) 
 Quantity (number)  
 Unit price  
 Unit type (default from service definition; editable if permitted)  
(per equipment / per person / per day / per session / Per visit  / Per Linear Meter ) 
 Line total = qty × unit price  
 Notes (optional)  
 Description box along each  line item / service  
o Description should auto -populate from Service Master  by default (service 
description / scope summary if maintained there)  
o Coordinator may add quote -specific notes (optional)  
Important rule:  pricing fields are visible only to roles like  Coordinator/Admin/Finance (not 
Inspector).  
If a required service is missing from Service Master  
System should support one of the following (configurable policy):  
 Service Request to Quality:  coordinator submits a “service request” from quotation; 
Quality creates/publishes service; then it becomes selectable.  
OR 

=== Page 21 ===

 Coordinator creates a service entry flagged “Pending Quality Review”:  
o Service is created in draft/temporary state and clearly flagged  
 becomes selectable immediately (but flagged), or 
4) VAT & Totals  
 VAT % default 15% (editable per quotation)  
 System calculates:  
o Subtotal  
o VAT amount  
o Grand total  
Also generate:  
 Total in digits  
 Total in words (e.g., “One hundred twenty -three thousand SAR only”)  
5) Terms & Conditions (Preset Sets + Payment Term)  
Step 5A — Select T&Cs Set (preloaded)  
Coordinator selects 1 preset template, e.g.:  
 Inspection T&Cs  
 Training T&Cs  
 Testing/NDT T&Cs  
 Online testing T&Cs  
 (You can add more)  
Step 5B — Pricing/Payment Ter m (manual field)  
Coordinator must fill a single “Payment Terms” field each time, examples:  
 100% advance  
 50% advance, 50% on delivery of certificates  
 100% upon delivery of certificates  
 As per PO  
 Credit period: 30 days, 60 days, etc.  
(Everything else stays s tandardized.)  
Step 5B — Bilingial  

=== Page 22 ===

The quotation will be bilingual English and Arabic (All headers and Total Amounts will be 
bilingual)  
6) Generate Quotation PDF (Standard Format)  
 Use your uploaded quotation template (letterhead style)  
 Insert:  
o Client + project  
o Line items table  
o VAT summary  
o Total in words and digits  
o Selected T&Cs set  
o Payment terms (custom field)  
o Signature block (your company)  
o Company Account information  
System outputs:  
 PDF stored in the system  
 Quote version (v1, v2…) if edited after sendin g 
Note (Service Master alignment): the PDF should render service 
name/description as captured at the time of quotation, while internally 
the quotation retains service_id + service_version_id for traceability.  
7) Send to Client + Track  
Coordinator actions:  
 “Send Quotation” button:  
o email to selected client contact(s)  
o attach PDF  
o or download and send  
System:  
 Marks status = Sent  
 Logs time + recipients  
8) Acceptance (How quote becomes usable for JO)  
Acceptance methods (choose one on the quote):  

=== Page 23 ===

 PO received (enter  PO number + upload)  
 Verbal confirmation (enter who confirmed + notes)  
 Email confirmation (upload/email reference)  
System:  
 Marks status = Accepted  
 Locks pricing (no edits unless “Revise quote” creates new version)  
Outputs  
 Quotation record + version history  
 PDF document  
 Selected T&Cs set + payment term text  
 Accepted confirmation evidence (PO/verbal/email)  
 Ready flag: “Create JO from this Quote”  
Service Master Registry traceability (added):  
 Each line item retains:  
o service_id  
o service_version_id  
o service name/de scription snapshot used for PDF and history  
This ensures Job Orders and audits always reference the correct governed 
service definition used at quotation time.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

=== Page 24 ===

Workflow: Job Order Creation (Based on Accepted Quotation)  
Purpose  
Enable a Coordinator to create and control a Job Order (JO) strictly from an Accepted 
Quotation , while:  
 selecting full or partial quotation items  
 optionally changing prices (permission configurable per coordinator role)  
 preparing preloaded execution items  for field staff  
 tracking planned vs executed quantities  
 supporting multi -inspector / multi -role assignment  
 allowing on-site added services/equipment  without blocking execution  
 enforcing commercial control before final issuance  
 ensuring ISO/IEC 17020 inspec tion request compliance  
 maintaining full audit traceability and governance  
1. Entry Rule  
 A Job Order can only  be created from an Accepted Quotation  
 “Accepted” means at least one of the following is recorded:  
o Purchase Order (attached)  
o Verbal confirmation (recorded)  
o Email confirmation (attached)  
Action  
Coordinator clicks “Create Job Order”  on the accepted quotation.  
2. JO Draft Auto -Creation (From Quotation)  
System automatically creates a JO draft , inheriting read -only reference data  from the 
quotation:  
 Client 
 Project / Site  
 Client contacts  
 Quotation number & version (reference only)  
 All quotation line items:  
o Service  
o Service version (from Service Master Registry)  
o Quantities  
o Prices  

=== Page 25 ===

At this stage:  
 All quotation items appear by default  
 No execution data exists yet 
3. Select Scope for Job Order (Full / Partial)  
Coordinator reviews quotation items in a tabular scope -selection view . 
Options  
 Select All  
 Include item in JO (checkbox)  
 Exclude item from JO  
Rules  
 Only selected items  become part of the JO  
 Excluded items:  
o remain part of the quotation  
o are not visible  to inspectors or trainers  
o are not executable  
This establishes the operational scope  of the JO.  
4. Quantity & Price Adjustment (Controlled)  
4.1 Quantity Adjustment (Allowed)  
Coordinator may adjust planned quantit ies per selected service item.  
Example:  
 Quoted: Mobile Crane Inspection – Qty 5  
 JO Planned: Mobile Crane Inspection – Qty 3  
Rules:  
 Planned quantity = expected execution  
 This is not final billing quantity  
 Original quoted quantity is preserved for traceabili ty 

=== Page 26 ===

4.2 Price Adjustment (Permission -Based)  
 Unit prices are locked by default  
 Price modification is allowed only if:  
o Coordinator role permits it OR 
o Manager approval is granted  
Mandatory system logging:  
 Old price  
 New price  
 Changed by  
 Date & time  
 Change reason  
Hard rule:  
Inspectors and trainers never see prices . 
5. Create Preloaded Execution Items (Critical Requirement)  
For each selected service item with planned quantity > 0, the system generates preloaded 
execution instances , based on the service_versio n. 
Example  
 Inspection – Mobile Crane – Qty 3  
→ Creates:  
 Mobile Crane #1  
 Mobile Crane #2  
 Mobile Crane #3  
 NDT – MPT – Qty 1  
→ Creates:  
 MPT Test #1  
These execution instances:  
 Are visible to inspectors/trainers  
 Eliminate dropdown searching in the field  
 Are later linked to:  

=== Page 27 ===

o actual equipment (via registry/QR/sticker)  
o actual persons (operators/trainees)  
Applies to:  
 Inspections  
 Testing (NDT and non -NDT)  
 Operator Certification (person -based)  
 Training topics / participant slots  
This step is essential to make field  execution fast, structured, and error -free. 
6. Assignment & Teaming  
Coordinator assigns personnel to the JO:  
 One or more Inspectors  
 Trainers / Examiners (if applicable)  
 Optional Lead Inspector  
Capabilities  
 Multiple inspectors can work on the same JO  
 Inspe ctor + Trainer can be assigned together  
 Any assigned inspector’s name may appear on final certificates (based on actual 
execution)  
 Regional teams are supported  
System actions  
 Sends notifications to all assigned staff  
 Records assignment history  
Delegation  
 Assigned inspector may reassign/share the JO with another inspector  
 Coordinator is notified  
 All reassignments are audit logged  
7. JO Creation & Status  
 

=== Page 28 ===

Coordinator clicks “Create Job Order”  
System:  
 Generates JO number  
 Sets JO status:  
o Draft (not yet assigne d), or 
o Scheduled (assigned)  
 Locks the initial planned scope  
 Allows controlled coordinator edits  during execution phase  
 Stores permanent linkage to:  
o Original quotation (commercial intent)  
o JO-selected scope (operational truth)  
8. Change Handling During Execu tion (Operational Reality)  
8.1 Quantity Changes by Inspector  
During execution:  
 Some equipment may not be inspected  
 Some trainees may not attend  
Inspector records actual executed quantities . 
System:  
 Preserves original planned quantity  
 Stores actual executed  quantity separately  
 Maintains full traceability:  
o Quoted → Planned → Executed  
8.2 Additional Items Added at Site (Offline -Safe)  
If the client requests additional inspection or testing services  at site:  
Inspector may:  
 Add new service item from the Service M aster Catalog  
 Enter quantity and justification notes  
System behavior:  
 Flags item as “Added at Site”  

=== Page 29 ===

 Blocks all price visibility  
 Records:  
o who added it  
o when  
o justification  
Critical Execution Rule (Offline -Safe):  
 Inspector is allowed to immediately execute  added -on-site items  
 Inspector may:  
o complete checklists / assessments  
o include items in FIR  
o generate draft reports/certificates (without background)  
Coordinator approval is NOT required to proceed with execution.  
This ensures:  
 no execution delays in remote/ no-internet locations  
 no loss of operational data  
 no opportunity for silent execution outside the system  
8.3 Approval & Pricing Gate Before Final Issuance (Commercial Control)  
Before final issuance, publishing, or finance handoff , the system enforces a con trol gate:  
If any items are marked “Added at Site”  and are Pending Coordinator Approval : 
System blocks:  
 final certificate issuance  
 publishing to client  
 finance submission  
Coordinator must:  
 Review added -on-site items  
 Assign internal pricing  to each approved item  
 Approve or reject the item  
Once approved:  
 Item becomes part of the JO operational scope  
 Pricing is recorded internally  

=== Page 30 ===

 Item flows to Finance for invoicing  
 Final issuance is unblocked  
All actions are:  
 Logged  
 Attributed  
 Fully traceable  
9. Finance Reference Output (Clarity Only)  
(Not a finance workflow)  
Finance will later receive:  
 Original quotation  
 JO planned scope  
 Actual executed quantities  
 Approved on -site added items with coordinator -assigned prices  
This forms a clean, auditable basi s for invoicing.  
10. Inspection Request Capture (ISO/IEC 17020 – Controlled & 
Mandatory)  
Purpose  
Ensure every Job Order has a controlled Internal Inspection Request record  that:  
 documents what the client requested  
 records how the request was received  
 conso lidates scope and quantities  
 provides objective evidence for ISO/IEC 17020  
 becomes part of the controlled JO file  
Key Principle  
Regardless of how the request is received (PO, email, verbal), the system always generates an 
Internal Inspection Request Form . 
10.1 Mandatory Internal Inspection Request Form  
 

=== Page 31 ===

For every JO, the system generates one Internal Inspection Request Form . 
This form is:  
 Mandatory  
 Non -deletable  
 Version -controlled  
 Audit logged  
 Permanently linked to the JO  
Clients are not required to submit this form themselves.  
10.2 Timing Rule  
The Inspection Request Form must be generated:  
 After JO scope is finalized  
 Before JO is marked Created / Scheduled  
JO creation cannot complete  without this step.  
10.3 Request Source Selection (Mandatory)  
System prompt s: 
“How was the inspection request received?”  
Coordinator selects one: 
1. Purchase Order (PO)  
2. Email  
3. Verbal Request  
4. Other (configurable)  
10.4 Auto -Populated Inspection Request Fields  
System -generated form includes:  
 Client name  
 Project / site  
 Client requestor /  contact  
 Date of request (auto -derived)  
 

=== Page 32 ===

Date of Request Rule  
 PO → PO issue date  
 Email → email confirmation date  
 Verbal → quotation issue date  
Date is locked once generated.  
10.5 Source Evidence Attachment  
 PO → PO document attached  
 Email → email PDF attach ed 
 Verbal → internal form itself is evidence  
 Other → optional supporting docs  
Attachments support  the form; they do not replace it.  
10.6 ISO/IEC 17020 Compliance Rules  
 Exactly one Inspection Request Form per JO  
 Form is mandatory, non -deletable, version -locked  
 Source is declared and auditable  
 All changes are traceable (who / when / why)  
Key Design Principles (Developer Guidance)  
 Quotation = commercial intent  
 Job Order = operational truth  
 Execution = factual truth  
 No overwrites — only versioning an d deltas  
 Inspectors never see prices  
 Every change records:  
o Who  
o When  
o Why

Workflow: Sticker Management Module (Series & Inventory 
Control)  
Purpose  
Provide strict control, traceability, and accountability  over inspection stickers by treating them 
as controlled inventory , ensuring:  
 every sticker number is traceable  
 every used sticker is tied to a report  
 misuse, wastage, or unreported inspections are detectable  
 inspectors cannot use stickers without system records  
1. Sticker Definition (Physical Reality ) 
Sticker Types Covered  
 Big Stickers  (large equipment)  
 Small Stickers  (small tools)  
Each physical sticker has:  
 A pre-printed unique sticker number  
 A common QR code  (same on all stickers)  
o QR redirects to a verification webpage  
o User enters sticker number or certificate number to retrieve report  
The system does not generate individual QR codes.  
2. Sticker Series Registration (Stock Entry)  
Action: Register New Sticker Series  
When stickers are received from printing facility:  
Coordinator/Admin enters:  
 Sticker type (Big / Small)  
 Series start number (e.g. 0001)  
 Series end number (e.g. 1000)  
 Printing batch reference (optional)  

=== Page 34 ===

 Date received  
System behavior:  
 Creates individual sticker records  internally:  
o Sticker #0001  
o Sticker #0002  
o … 
o Sticker #1000  
 All stickers star t with status: In Stock  
This step is mandatory  before stickers can be issued.  
3. Sticker Bundling (Operational Convenience)  
Purpose  
Allow bulk control while keeping individual traceability.  
Coordinator can:  
 Create bundles from registered series, e.g.:  
o Bundle A: 0001 –0100  
o Bundle B: 0101 –0200  
Each bundle has:  
 Bundle ID  
 Sticker range  
 Status  
4. Issuing Stickers to Inspectors (Critical Control Point)  
Action: Issue Sticker Bundle  
Coordinator assigns a bundle to an inspector.  
System records:  
 Inspector name  
 Sticker range issued  
 Issue date  
 Issued by (coordinator)  

=== Page 35 ===

Sticker status changes:  
 From In Stock  
 To Issued to Inspector  
At this point:  
 Inspector is fully accountable  for every sticker in the range  
5. Inspector Sticker Usage During Inspection  
Inspector Action (Field)  
While preparing inspection data or report:  
 Inspector must enter sticker number  applied to the equipment  
System Validation (Hard Rules)  
System checks:  
 Sticker number exists  
 Sticker is issued to that inspector  
 Sticker status = Issued (not used / not invalid)  
If valid:  
 Sticker status changes to Used  
 Sticker is automatically linked to:  
o Equipment  
o Job Order  
o Inspection report / certificate number  
If invalid:  
 System blocks submission  
 Inspector cannot proceed  
6. Automatic Sticker –Report Mapping  
System maintains a live sticker usage table : 
Sticker No  Inspector  Status  Report No  JO No  Equipment  

=== Page 36 ===

0043  Inspector A  Used  RPT-2025 -041 JO-118 Mobile Crane  
0044  Inspector A  Used  RPT-2025 -042 JO-118 Forklift  
0045  Inspector A  Unused  — — — 
This table is not editable . 
7. Unused & Suspicious Sticker Detection (Key Feature)  
Automatic Monitoring  
System continuously checks:  
 Stickers issued but never reported used  
 Large gaps in usage  
 Stickers issued long ago but still unused  
Highlighting Rules  
 Stickers unused beyo nd next issuance → Flagged  
 Frequent unused stickers → Inspector risk indicator  
This directly exposes:  
 Unreported inspections  
 Potential misuse  
 Loss or leakage  
8. Lost / Damaged Sticker Reporting  
Inspector Action  
If sticker is:  
 Lost 
 Damaged  
 Misprinted  
Inspector must:  
 Mark sticker as Lost/Damaged  
 Provide reason (mandatory)  
 Upload picture of damaged sticker  

=== Page 37 ===

The event must be verified and marked accepted by coordinator  
System:  
 Marks sticker as Invalid  
 Prevents future use  
 Logs incident permanently  
9. Verification via Common QR Code  
Public Verification Flow  
Anyone scans QR on:  
 Sticker OR  
 Certificate  
System opens verification page : 
 User enters:  
o Sticker number OR  
o Certificate number Or  
o Both  
System displays:  
 Inspection status  
 Equipment details  
 Validity  
This keeps QR simple and robust.  
10. Inspector Stock View & Requests  
Inspector can view:  
 Sticker range issued  
 Used stickers  
 Remaining stickers  
 Lost/damaged stickers  
Inspector can:  

=== Page 38 ===

 Request additional sticker bundles via system  
11. Low Stock & Reorder Alerts  
System -Level Monitoring  
System tracks:  
 Total unissued stock  
 Issued but unused stock  
Alerts:  
 Low stock threshold reached → notify coordinator  
 Reorder reminder generated  
12. Management & Audit Reports  
System provides reports:  
 Stickers issued per inspector  
 Stickers used vs issued  
 Unused stickers per inspector  
 Lost/damaged stickers  
 Sticker → Report → Certificate traceability

Job Order Execution Workflow  
Inspection & Testing (Offline -First, Audit -Ready)  
Inspector App – Offline -First Execution +  FIR + Certificate/Test Report Issuance + Publishing + 
Finance Handoff  
This is the end -to-end execution workflow for inspection and testing job orders , including 
offline -first operation, FIR generation, client signature or acceptance, optional approval routing, 
certificate/test report issuance, letterhead control, publishing, and finance handoff.  
0. Purpose  
Define the end -to-end operational workflow for executing inspection and testing services  
under a Job Order (JO), including:  
• execution against prelo aded service -based scope  
• evidence capture and checklist completion  
• controlled sticker usage (where applicable)  
• FIR generation and client sign -off (or client -absent email acceptance)  
• certificate / test report package generation (with optional approv al routing)  
• letterhead (paper) control via background finalization  
• publishing and verification  
• finance handoff for invoicing  
This workflow applies to:  
• Equipment Inspections  
• NDT services  
• Non -NDT testing services (load tests, pressure tests, func tional tests, Amma test, Hydro tests 
etc.)  
A. Preconditions  

=== Page 40 ===

 
A1. Job Order Setup  
• Job Order exists and includes:  
 Client + site/project + client contact(s)  
 At least one client email address (mandatory if FIR signature is not captured)  
 One or more service l ine items  (Inspection / NDT / Testing / etc.)  
 Preloaded execution instances  generated from the JO scope  
(e.g., Mobile Crane #1…#N, Load Test #1…#N, UT Test #1…#N)  
Important Alignment  
Execution is driven by Service Versions  from the Service Registry, not 
free-form equipment selection.  
A2. Inspection / Testing Request Record  
• An Internal Inspection Request Form  exists and is linked to the JO  
• Generated during JO creation  
• No approval workflow applies to this form  
A3. Asset  & Equipment Policy  
System policy defines whether:  
• assets must exist in Equipment Registry, OR  
• inspector may add unregistered equipment (creates draft asset pending sync)  
A4. Service Policy (from Service Registry)  
For each service version, the system d efines:  
• checklist behavior  
 default checklist level (Simplified / Expanded / Critical)  
 whether Critical is mandatory  
• approval policy  

=== Page 41 ===

 approval required (Yes/No)  
 approver role (Technical Manager / NDT Manager / etc.)  
• certificate / test report outputs  
• validity rules (if applicable)  
• sticker requirement:  
 Required  
 Optional  
 Not Applicable  
B. Inspector Execution (Offline -First)  
B1. Receive Assignment  
• Online: notification  
• Offline: JO available if previously synced  
B2. Open Job Order  
UI displays:  
• Client / site / project  
• Service -based scope summary  
• Assigned service line items  
Inspector taps Start  
System records:  
• started_at timestamp  
• JO status → In Progress (local if offline)  
B3. Select Service Line Item & Execution Instance  
Examples:  
• Inspe ction – Mobile Crane → Mobile Crane #1  

=== Page 42 ===

• NDT – Magnetic Particle Test → MPT #1  
• Testing – Load Test → Load Test #1  
UI displays:  
• Preloaded execution instances  
• Option to add additional execution instances (policy -controlled)  
B4. Asset / Subject Identification (Service -Dependent)  
Depending on service type:  
Inspection Services  
• Select from:  
1. Preloaded equipment instance  
2. Equipment Registry  
3. Add ad -hoc equipment (draft asset)  
Testing Services (NDT / Non -NDT)  
• Equipment selection may be:  
 mandatory (e. g., load test on crane)  
 optional (e.g., weld UT)  
 descriptive only  
• Service definition governs requirement  
B5. Equipment / Subject Data Capture  
• Capture or confirm identity data:  
 Manufacturer, model, serial, capacity, etc. (if applicable)  
• OCR via data p late allowed  
• Human confirmation mandatory  
• Stored as inspection/test snapshot  

=== Page 43 ===

 
If previous inspection exists:  
• Inspector may enter or scan previous sticker number  to preload identity  
• If no sticker applies → handled in B11  
B6. Validity Selection (If Applicable)  
• Quick buttons: 1 / 3 / 6 / 12 months + Custom  
• Validity rules enforced by Service Registry  
• If inspector exceeds allowed validity:  
 approval workflow triggered automatically  
B7. Checklist Execution (Service -Driven)  
Checklist is loaded from Document Registry  via Service Version . 
Checklist behavior:  
• Default checklist level applied  
• Expansion allowed unless locked  
• Mandatory Critical checklist enforced where defined  
Checklist supports:  
• Pass / Fail / N/A  
• Numeric readings with units  
• Comm ents  
• Photo evidence (mandatory on Fail)  
Header fields include:  
• Service name  

=== Page 44 ===

• Equipment / subject details (if applicable)  
• Standard reference  
• Work instruction reference  
• Manufacturer  
• Model / Year  
• VIN / Serial No.  
• Last date of inspection (manual entry or fetched from previous record)  
• Inspector name  
• Date of inspection  
• Next date of inspection  
• Location (Site / project Details as per JO)  
• JO number  
• Any additional fields configured at checklist creation  
B8. Tools Used  
• Inspector sel ects tools used (from Tools Registry)  
• Tool calibration visibility enabled  
• Mandatory tool selection enforced where defined  
 Every inspector shall have a set of tools issued to him in Tools registry. Those all ll appear as 
tabs and he can just click on ta bs to mention the ones used during inspection.  
B9. Evidence Capture  
• Photos / documents:  
 captured live OR uploaded  
• Minimum evidence enforced per service  

=== Page 45 ===

• Stored offline and synced later  
B10. Outcome  
Inspector records outcome:  
• Pass / Fail / Not Inspected  
Fail handling:  
• Mandatory findings notes  
• Mandatory evidence  
• Voice -to-text allowed  
B11. Sticker / Tag Handling (Controlled & Conditional)  
B11.1 Sticker Requirement Decision  
Sticker behavior is governed by Service Version : 
Case A – Sticker Req uired  
• Inspector must enter or scan sticker number  
• Validation:  
 sticker exists  
 issued to inspector  
 unused  
Case B – Sticker Optional  
• Inspector may enter sticker number OR select:  
→ Sticker Not Applicable  
Case C – Sticker Not Applicable  
(Examples:  
• NDT services  

=== Page 46 ===

• Non -tagged equipment  
• Certain inspections defined by Quality)  
• Inspector must explicitly select:  
→ Sticker Not Applicable  
• System records justification automatically via service policy  
System will not allow submission  if: 
• sticker is required AND  
• neither a sticker number nor “Not Applicable” is selected  
B11.2 Offline Sticker Reservation  
• Offline: sticker marked Reserved (Offline)  
• Final validation occurs on sync  
Sticker becomes Used  only when:  
• execution is finalized AND  
• certifi cate/test report record is created  
B12. Repeat Loop  
Repeat B3 –B11 for all execution instances.  
B13. Added -at-Site Scope  
• Inspector may add additional services/equipment  
• Marked as Added at Site  
• Execution allowed immediately (offline -safe)  
• Pricing hid den 
• Coordinator assigns price later before final issuance  
B14. Complete Site Work  

=== Page 47 ===

Inspector taps Complete Today’s Work  
Triggers FIR generation.  
C. FIR (Field Inspection Report) + Client 
Signature / Client Absent Email Acceptance  
C1. FIR Generation Rule (Multiple FIRs per JO)  
Under one Job Order, there can be multiple FIRs , generated whenever the inspector completes 
a subset of work.  
FIR Numbering (per JO)  
FIR number format:  
 FIR-JO<JO_NUMBER> -01 
 next FIR in same JO: …-02, …-03 etc. 
 for a new JO, numbering  restarts at …-01 
Trigger: each time inspector chooses to finalize a visit/subset and generate FIR.  
C2. Auto -generate FIR Draft (Offline -Capable)  
FIR aggregates all equipment handled in that FIR instance (subset), including:  
 JO + client/site/project  
 inspec tor name  
 arrival/start time on site (if captured)  
 equipment list (equipment type, serial no, manufacturer, sticker no) + outcomes  
 tools used summary (as captured)  
 timestamp + location fields if enabled (for indivisual inspector in HR module)  
Offline: FIR saved as PendingSync . 
C3. Signature Capture (Standard Case)  
Client representative fields:  
 name  
 title 

=== Page 48 ===

 phone  
 signature  
Signature captured on inspector device.  
FIR finalized and queued for sync.  
C4. Client Absent / Signature Not Captured (Control led 
Exception)  
If signature cannot be captured, inspector selects:  
 Client Absent / Not Available  (or similar controlled reason)  
C4.1 Email Requirement Logic  
System checks if client email exists on JO contact(s):  
 If exists → proceed  
 If missing → app prompts  inspector to enter client email (mandatory)  
C4.2 System Email Acceptance Disclaimer  
On issuance (after sync), system emails the FIR to the client contact with disclaimer text 
embedded in the email:  
 client was not present at time of FIR closure  
 FIR is treated as accepted unless the client replies with objections within a defined 
period (you may set this policy, e.g., 24 hours, or “promptly”)  
C4.3 Evidence Binding  
The sent email record (message metadata / PDF attachment / delivery record as available) 
becomes part of FIR (last page) record as supporting evidence.  
C5. FIR Issuance and Distribution  
After sync:  
 server generates FIR PDF  
 auto -email FIR PDF to client contact  
 inspector gets “Copy share link” (public -but-unguessable token link)  

=== Page 49 ===

D. Certificate / R eport Package Generation, 
Approval, Issuance  
D1. Generate Draft Package  
System generates documents per completed equipment instance / line item.  
Failed Item Handling  
 Certificates for Failed items are still issued with status “Failed”  
 Failed certificates do not require  letterhead number entry  
 Failed certificates may be rendered with background (letterhead) by default  and are 
publishable without letterhead control  
 
D2. Optional Approval Routing (Policy -Driven)  
 
If requires_approval = true for that equipment subtype/line item:  
 system notifies configured approver role  
 approver approves/rejects  
 on rejection, inspector receives reason and rework required  
If approval not required:  
 documents can be issued immediately  
D3. Certificate Issuance  (Digital Plain Print Version)  
On issuance:  
 system creates official PDF without background  (plain) intended for printing  
 inspector and relvant document controller receives notification  
D3.1 Numbering Rule  
Certificates must be uniquely numbered, non -sequent ial and non -guessable.  

=== Page 50 ===

Prefix contains the string you specified only in the certificate numbering format , not in 
narrative text, e.g.:  
 TUVINSP -JO01 -15975  
Next could be:  
 TUVINSP -JO01 -21282  
(Only used as the internal visible certificate identifier string.)  
E. Letterhead Control and Background 
Finalization  
E1. Background Definition  
“Background” refers to Times United’s letterhead template overlay  used by the system for final 
archival rendering, matching the printed letterhead design.  
E2. Printing on Pre -numbe red Letterhead  
Likely desktop flow:  
 Inspector or relevant document controller prints the no-background  PDF onto the pre -
numbered letterhead paper.  
E3. Enter Letterhead/Paper Number  
Inspector or relevant document controller enters paper number per certifica te. 
System validates:  
 number not already used  
 correct format (configured)  
E4. Generate Final Archival Digital Copy  
System re -renders the certificate with:  
 letterhead background overlay  

=== Page 51 ===

 embedded paper/letterhead number  
This becomes the controlled archival digital version (no scanning required).  
F. Publish to Client  
F1. Publish Documents  
Authorized roles (inspector/document controller/coordinator) can publish.  
Client access methods:  
 client portal, or  
 shareable token link (public -but-unguessable)  
 download and  share pdf  
F2. Publishing Rules by Outcome  
 Failed certificates:  publishable immediately (no letterhead dependency)  
 Passed certificates:  publishable once final archival copy is generated (paper number 
recorded)  
F3. JO Closure  
JO is marked Closed  once:  
 requi red documents are issued and published (as per scope), AND  
 FIR(s) are issued for the completed work  
G. Offline Sync and Conflict Resolution (Explicit 
Rule)  
G1. Sticker Conflicts  
Handled per Section B11 (Reserved → Used; reassign if conflict).  
G2. New/Unreg istered Equipment Conflicts  

=== Page 52 ===

On sync, if a newly created offline equipment record matches an existing registry record (e.g., 
same serial/VIN):  
 system prompts merge/attach to existing equipment record  
 prevents duplicate asset creation  
 logs merge decision  
G3. Evidence Upload Failures  
If evidence fails to upload:  
 inspection submission remains PendingSync  
 app prompts retry  
 system prevents issuance if mandatory evidence is missing (policy)  
H. Finance Handoff and Invoicing  
H1. Send JO Summary to Finance  
System ema ils Finance (or creates finance task) including:  
 services delivered (actual executed quantities)  
 equipment list, operators List (category and quantity), Trainees List (category and 
quantity), Conducted Tests Details  
 certificate numbers  
 quotation reference  
 approved Added -at-Site pricing references (entered by coordinator after approval)  
H2. Finance Updates JO  
Finance enters:  
 invoice number  
 invoice amount  
System sets JO status to Invoiced . 
Key Design Principles  
 Offline -first with controlled sync  
 Preloaded execution instances  reduce field friction and prevent scope hiding  

=== Page 53 ===

 No price visibility to inspectors  
 No overwrites: only versioning and deltas  
 Sticker inventory is controlled and auditable  (Reserved → Used)  
 FIR is enforceable evidence  via signature or clie nt-absent email acceptance  
 Letterhead number control is traceable  and produces final archival copy  
 Publishing rules reflect pass/fail requirements  
I . Checklist Quick -Completion Option (“All OK” Function)  
Purpose  
Reduce inspection execution time and inspector exposure in harsh environmental conditions by 
allowing rapid completion of technical inspection checkpoints where risk and complexity 
permit , without compromising mandatory equipment identification data or tra ceability.  
Scope Limitation (Non -Negotiable Rule)  
This function applies only to technical inspection checkpoints . 
It does NOT apply to : 
 Mandatory equipment identification information  
 Equipment data capture (manufacturer, serial, capacity, etc.)  
 Evidence ca pture requirements (photos, readings, notes)  
 Any checklist item marked as mandatory by policy  
Mandatory equipment information must always  be completed manually or loaded from 
previous record using previous sticker no.  
Function Description  
For eligible equipment categories, the checklist UI shall include a dedicated action button:  
“All OK”  
This button appears:  
 At the end of the technical inspection checkpoints  
 Within the selected checklist level (Simplified / Expanded / Critical)  
System Behavior (When “A ll OK” Is Selected)  
Upon inspector action:  

=== Page 54 ===

• All visible technical checklist items in the current checklist level are automatically set to:  
 Pass / OK  
 No defects recorded  
• Optional fields (comments, numeric readings) remain blank unless required by policy  
• Mandatory evidence rules still apply (e.g., required photos or readings must still be captured)  
• The inspector must explicitly confirm  the action via a confirmation prompt:  
“Confirm that all technical inspection checkpoints have been verified 
and are co mpliant.”  
Equipment Registry Control (Policy -Driven)  
Availability of the “All OK”  function is controlled at the Equipment Registry level . 
Each equipment category/subtype includes a policy flag:  
Allow Quick Checklist Completion (All OK):  YES / NO  
Rules:  
 If YES: 
o “All OK” button is visible and enabled  
 If NO: 
o “All OK” button is hidden  
o Inspector must manually complete each checklist item  
Risk-Based Application Guidance (Design Intent)  
Typically enabled  for: 
 Small tools  
 Low-risk equipment  
 Simple, repetitive in spections  
 Visual -only inspection categories  
Typically disabled  for: 
 Cranes  
 Lifting equipment  
 Pressure systems  

=== Page 55 ===

 High -risk or regulated assets  
 Equipment requiring detailed measurements or multiple evidence points  
Audit & Traceability Rules  
 
• System logs usage of the “All OK” function:  
 Inspector name  
 Date & time  
 Equipment type  
 Checklist level used  
• Excessive or inappropriate use of this function can be reviewed via audit reports (optional 
KPI).  
Fail-Safe Rule  
If any checklist item within the selected leve l is marked as:  
 Mandatory individual confirmation  
 Mandatory numeric input  
 Mandatory evidence  
Then:  
 That item is excluded  from the “All OK” auto -completion  
 Inspector must complete it manually before submission

Workflow: Operator Certification Execution  
Purpose  
Enable an Inspector / Trainer (Assessor)  to complete Operator Certification  within an existing 
Job Order (JO) using two execution modes:  
 On-Site (face -to-face assessment)  
 Off-Site (online assessment via secure link)  
Certification consists of two mandatory parts : 
1. Proforma  – Operator identity, experience, previous training/certification  
2. Assessment  – Trade -specific questions (and practical confirmation)  
Primary output:  
✅ Wallet Card (Operator Card)  
⚠️ A4 Certificate issu ed only when required by client  
General Rules (Applies to Both Modes)  
 Operator Certification must exist in the JO  
 Preloaded operator categories/slots come from JO  
 Inspector must review and finalize  every candidate  
 No candidate becomes Finalized  without ins pector approval  
A) On -Site Operator Certification  
(Inspector & Operator Face -to-Face)

software and then enter the detaiks of Invoice number and 
Invoice amount againts the JO.   
Finance enters:  
 Invoice number  
 Invoice date  
 Amount  
 Due date  
 
System updates:  
 JO status → Invoiced  
 Link invoice  no to JO  
 Make sure invoice no. is not repeated. And if repeated, notification sent to Admin  
 Make sure should not be difefrence of more than 15 SAR between the calculated invoice 
amount and the amount entered by finance dept. If theres any dif ference, notofication 
sent to admin.  
 Any closed JO must be invoiced with 24 hours. Any delays must be notification to admin.  
 
8. Post -Invoicing Adjustments (Controlled)  
If correction is needed:  
 Original invoice is not edited  
 Credit note or revised invoice is created (future phase)  
9. Reporting & Audit  
Finance can view/export:  
 Invoices by date/client  
 Revenue by service type  
 JO vs Invoice reconciliation  
 Client Satatement of Account

Workflow: Inspection Tools, Instruments & Assets Registry  
(Tools Usage Log + Calibration Control + Asset Accountability)  
Purpose  
Establish a controlled, traceable system  for managing:  
• inspection tools & measuring instruments  
• testing instruments  
• shared and non -shared tools  
• company assets (vehicles, IT, kit s, equipment)  
• calibration compliance  
• usage logging (ISO/IEC 17020 requirement)  
So that:  
• every inspection/test records which tools were used  
• every tool has a responsible owner/user  
• expired or uncalibrated tools cannot be used  
• shared tools are pr operly issued and returned  
• assets are always traceable to a person/location  
This module supports:  
• Inspection workflow  
• Testing workflow  
• HR module (staff accountability)  
• Audit & accreditation requirements  
Module Structure (High -Level)  

=== Page 98 ===

This module has two tightly related parts : 
1. Inspection Tools & Instruments Registry  
2. Company Assets Registry  
Both share:  
• issuance logic  
• responsibility tracking  
• audit logs  
PART 1: Inspection Tools & Instruments Registry  
1. Ownership & Roles  
Registry Owner  
• Quality Department (preferred) or Admin (configurable)  or Coordinator  
Roles & Permissions  
• Admin / Quality:  
 create tools  
 edit tool records  
 upload calibration certificates  
 assign/unassign tools  
• Coordinators:  
 issue shared tools  
 view usage logs  
• Inspectors:  
 view tools issued to them  
 select tools during execution  
 cannot edit tool master data  
2. Tool / Instrument Master Record

→ is automatically blocked from field use  
3. Tool Assignment Types  
The system supports two assignment models , exactly as you described.  

=== Page 100 ===

3.1 Permanently Assigned Tools (Default for Inspectors)  
Use case  
• Frequently used tools  
• Each inspector has a dedicated set  
Workflow  
• Admin/Coordinator assigns tools permanently to an inspector  
• Tool status = Issued (Permanent)  
• Inspector dashboard shows:  
 “My Tools”  
 only valid (calibrated) tools  
Field Impact  
• When inspector opens a Job Order:  
 his pre -assigned tools appear automatically  
 he simply clicks/selects tools used  
• No searching, no manual entry  
3.2 Shared / Temporarily Issued Tools  
Use case  
• Limited -quantity tools  
• Specialized equipment  
• High -value instruments  
Workflow  
• Tool remains with Coordinator  / Store  
• When required:  
 Coordinator issues tool to inspector  

=== Page 101 ===

 Issue duration may be defined (optional)  
• Tool status = Issued (Temporary)  
Inspector View  
• Tool appears in inspector’s available tools list  
• Only for the issuance period  
Return  
• Coordinator  marks tool as Returned  
• Tool status reverts to In Store / Available  
4. Tool Availability Rules (Critical Control)  
A tool appears in an inspector’s Job Order only if : 
• issued to that inspector (permanent or temporary)  
• calibration status = Valid  
• tool status ≠ Lost / Damaged / Suspended  
If any condition fails:  
• tool is hidden from Job Order execution UI  
5. Tool Selection During Inspection / Testing  
During Job Order execution:  
• Inspector opens service line item  
• “Tools Used” section is shown  
• Inspect or selects tool(s) used from his available list  
 
System records:  

=== Page 102 ===

• tool ID  
• tool name  
• inspector  
• JO number  
• service type  
• date & time  
This data automatically becomes part of:  
• inspection record  
• FIR  
• audit trail  
6. Automatic Tool Usage Log (ISO/IEC 17020 Core Requirement)  
The system automatically generates a Tool Usage Log . 
Each log entry contains:  
• Tool ID / serial number  
• Tool name  
• Inspector name  
• Job Order number  
• Service performed  
• Date & time used  
No manual log entry is allowed.  
Usage is recorded only  via actual execution.  
7. Calibration Control & Alerts  

=== Page 103 ===

System Monitoring  
• Tracks calibration expiry continuously  
Before Expiry  
• Alerts Quality / Admin  
• Optional alert to inspector  
After Expiry  
• Tool is:  
 automatically blocked  
 remov ed from inspector’s usable list  
• Cannot be selected in any Job Order  
Audit Benefit  
• Proves no expired instrument was used in inspection/testing  
8. Tool Loss / Damage Handling  
If a tool is:  
• lost  
• damaged  
• sent for repair  
User must:  
• mark tool as Lost  / Damaged / Under Repair  
• enter reason (mandatory)  
System:  
• blocks tool from use  
• logs event permanently  

=== Page 104 ===
